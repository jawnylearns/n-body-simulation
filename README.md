# A controlled n-body simulation.
<ins> ## Created using the inspiration and help from [this repository.]([url](https://github.com/pmocz/nbody-python/tree/master)) </ins>

This project simulates a 2D N-body gravitational system using Newtonian physics. Each body represents a massive object (like a star or planet), and all bodies interact with one another through gravity. 
The simulation demonstrates how these gravitational interactions influence the motion of the bodies over time. *This is an extremely controlled simulation.*

**Some Key Features**
- Customizable n-body system:
  The simulation tracks the motion of celestial bodies, characterized by the variable 'N', which can be changed to the users preference.

- Equidistant starting positions:
  All bodies begin arranged in a circle, equidistant from the center of the simulation.

- Continuous simulation:
  The system runs infinitely until manually closed, allowing users to observe long-term orbital behavior.

This simulation is a powerful visual and computational representation of gravitational dynamics, suitable for educational purposes or simply as a mesmerizing physics visualization.
